### [0399. Evaluate Division](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/evaluate-division/)

#### 问题描述
You are given an array of variable pairs `equations` and an array of real numbers `values`, where `equations[i] = [Ai, Bi] and values[i]` represent the equation `Ai / Bi = values[i]`. Each `Ai` or `Bi` is a string that represents a single variable.

You are also given some queries, where `queries[j] = [Cj, Dj]` represents the `jth` query where you must find the answer for `Cj / Dj` = ?.

Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return `-1.0`.

Note: The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.

**Example:**
```python
Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
Output: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]

Explanation:
Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ?
return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]
```
```python
Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
Output: [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]
```
```python
Input: equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]
Output: [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]
```

#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def calcEquation(self, equations: List[List[str]], values: List[float], queries: List[List[str]]) -> List[float]:
        # 通过将结果看作为边的权重将问题转化为求某两点间的距离
        from collections import defaultdict
        graph = defaultdict(int)
        valid_symbol = set()

        # 初始化
        for i in range(len(equations)):
            a, b = equations[i]
            graph[(a, b)] = values[i]   # 添加a/b的值(权重)
            graph[(b, a)] = 1/values[i] # 添加b/a的值(权重)
            valid_symbol.add(a)         # 在有效查询符号集合中添加a
            valid_symbol.add(b)         # 在有效查询符号集合中添加b

        # Floyd算法 求图中任意2点距离
        arr = list(valid_symbol)
        for k in arr:
            for i in arr:
                for j in arr:
                    if graph[(i, k)] and graph[(k, j)]:
                        graph[(i, j)] = graph[(i, k)] * graph[(k, j)]

        res = []
        for x, y in queries:
            if graph[(x, y)]:
                res.append(graph[(x, y)])
            else:
                res.append(-1)
        return res
