### [2128. Remove All Ones With Row and Column Flips](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-ones-with-row-and-column-flips/)

#### 问题描述
You are given an m x n binary matrix grid.

In one operation, you can choose any row or column and flip each value in that row or column (i.e., changing all 0's to 1's, and all 1's to 0's).

Return true if it is possible to remove all 1's from grid using any number of operations or false otherwise.

**Example:**
```python
Input: grid = [[0,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: One possible way to remove all 1's from grid is to:
- Flip the middle row
- Flip the middle column
```

#### 思路
Just a math problem.
Each row should be in same pattern then it's possible to remove all 1's.
**Same pattern** means row1 = row2 or row1 = inverted_row2
#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def removeOnes(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        patterns = [grid[0], [0 if ele else 1 for ele in grid[0]]]
        for row in grid[1:]:
            if row not in patterns:
                return False
        return True
```
