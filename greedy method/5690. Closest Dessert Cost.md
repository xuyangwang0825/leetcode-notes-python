### [5690. Closest Dessert Cost](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/miao/)

#### 问题描述
You would like to make dessert and are preparing to buy the ingredients. You have n ice cream base flavors and m types of toppings to choose from. You must follow these rules when making your dessert:

There must be exactly one ice cream base.
You can add one or more types of topping or have no toppings at all.
There are at most two of each type of topping.
You are given three inputs:

baseCosts, an integer array of length n, where each baseCosts[i] represents the price of the ith ice cream base flavor.
toppingCosts, an integer array of length m, where each toppingCosts[i] is the price of one of the ith topping.
target, an integer representing your target price for dessert.
You want to make a dessert with a total cost as close to target as possible.

Return the closest possible cost of the dessert to target. If there are multiple, return the lower one.

**Example:**
```python
Input: baseCosts = [1,7], toppingCosts = [3,4], target = 10
Output: 10
Explanation: Consider the following combination (all 0-indexed):
- Choose base 1: cost 7
- Take 1 of topping 0: cost 1 x 3 = 3
- Take 0 of topping 1: cost 0 x 4 = 0
Total: 7 + 3 + 0 = 10.
```
```python
Input: baseCosts = [2,3], toppingCosts = [4,5,100], target = 18
Output: 17
Explanation: Consider the following combination (all 0-indexed):
- Choose base 1: cost 3
- Take 1 of topping 0: cost 1 x 4 = 4
- Take 2 of topping 1: cost 2 x 5 = 10
- Take 0 of topping 2: cost 0 x 100 = 0
Total: 3 + 4 + 10 + 0 = 17. You cannot make a dessert with a total cost of 18.
```
```python
Input: baseCosts = [3,10], toppingCosts = [2,5], target = 9
Output: 8
Explanation: It is possible to make desserts with cost 8 and 10. Return 8 as it is the lower cost.
```
```python
Input: baseCosts = [10], toppingCosts = [1], target = 1
Output: 10
Explanation: Notice that you don't have to have any toppings, but you must have exactly one base.
```

#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def closestCost(self, baseCosts: List[int], toppingCosts: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        ans = baseCosts[0] # 初始化一个方案（不添加任何配料）
        # 枚举，将所有可能的方案加入li，共len(baseCosts)*3^len(toppingCosts)种
        li = baseCosts
        for cost in toppingCosts:
            for c in li.copy():
                li.append(c + cost)
                li.append(c + 2 * cost)
        # 遍历一遍所有方案，找到最接近target且成本相对较低的方案
        for a in li:
            if abs(a - target) < abs(ans - target) or abs(a - target) == abs(ans - target) and a < ans:
                ans = a
        return ans
