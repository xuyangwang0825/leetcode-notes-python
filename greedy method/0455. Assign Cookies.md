### [0455. Assign Cookies](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/assign-cookies/)

#### 问题描述
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

**Example:**
```python
Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
```
```python
Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.
```

排序+贪心

#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:
        g, s = sorted(g), sorted(s)
        g_pos, s_pos = 0, 0
        while g_pos < len(g) and s_pos < len(s):
            if g[g_pos] <= s[s_pos]:
                g_pos += 1
            s_pos += 1
        return g_pos
```
