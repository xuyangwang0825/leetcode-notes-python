### [0659. Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-into-consecutive-subsequences/)

#### 问题描述
You are given an integer array nums that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Determine if it is possible to split nums into one or more subsequences such that both of the following conditions are true:

Each subsequence is a consecutive increasing sequence (i.e. each integer is exactly one more than the previous integer).
All subsequences have a length of 3 or more.
Return true if you can split nums according to the above conditions, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of an array is a new array that is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements. (i.e., [1,3,5] is a subsequence of [1,2,3,4,5] while [1,3,2] is not).

**Example:**
```python
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation: nums can be split into the following subsequences:
[1,2,3,3,4,5] --> 1, 2, 3
[1,2,3,3,4,5] --> 3, 4, 5
```
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
Output: true
Explanation: nums can be split into the following subsequences:
[1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5] --> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
[1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5] --> 3, 4, 5
```
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,5]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to split nums into consecutive increasing subsequences of length 3 or more.

#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def isPossible(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        seqEnd = defaultdict(int)
        chars = Counter(nums)

        for num in nums:
            if not chars[num]:
                continue

            if seqEnd[num - 1] > 0:
                chars[num] -= 1
                seqEnd[num-1] -= 1
                seqEnd[num] += 1

            else:
                if not chars[num + 1] or not chars[num + 2]:
                    return False

                chars[num] -= 1
                chars[num+1] -= 1
                chars[num+2] -= 1
                seqEnd[num+2] += 1

        return True
