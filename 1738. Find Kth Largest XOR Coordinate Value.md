### [1738. Find Kth Largest XOR Coordinate Value](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/find-kth-largest-xor-coordinate-value/)

#### 问题描述
You are given a 2D matrix of size m x n, consisting of non-negative integers. You are also given an integer k.

The value of coordinate (a, b) of the matrix is the XOR of all matrix[i][j] where 0 <= i <= a < m and 0 <= j <= b < n (0-indexed).

Find the kth largest value (1-indexed) of all the coordinates of matrix.

**Example:**
```python
Input: matrix = [[5,2],[1,6]], k = 1
Output: 7
Explanation: The value of coordinate (0,1) is 5 XOR 2 = 7, which is the largest value.
```
```python
Input: matrix = [[5,2],[1,6]], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The value of coordinate (0,0) is 5 = 5, which is the 2nd largest value.
```
```python
Input: matrix = [[5,2],[1,6]], k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The value of coordinate (1,0) is 5 XOR 1 = 4, which is the 3rd largest value.
```
```python
Input: matrix = [[5,2],[1,6]], k = 4
Output: 0
Explanation: The value of coordinate (1,1) is 5 XOR 2 XOR 1 XOR 6 = 0, which is the 4th largest value.
