### [0001.Two Sum](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/two-sum/)

#### 问题描述

> Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have **exactly** one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

**Example:**
```python
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

#### 思路

#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        hdict = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            remain = target - nums[i]
            if nums[i] in hdict:
                return hdict[nums[i]],i
            else:
                hdict[remain] = i
```
