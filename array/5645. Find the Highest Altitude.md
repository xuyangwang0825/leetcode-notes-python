### [5645. Find the Highest Altitude](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/find-the-highest-altitude/)

#### 问题描述
There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.

You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i​​​​​​ and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.

**Example:**
```python
Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.
```
```python
Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.
```

#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def largestAltitude(self, gain: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        height = 0
        for i in gain:
            height += i
            res = max(res,height)
        return res
```
