### [0645. Set Mismatch](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/set-mismatch/)

#### 问题描述
You have a set of integers s, which originally contains all the numbers from 1 to n. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in s got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.

You are given an integer array nums representing the data status of this set after the error.

Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.

**Example:**
```python
Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
Output: [2,3]
```
```python
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [1,2]
```

#### 思路
- 数学方法
    - 计算去重后的和与未去重的和之差 -> 第一个数
    - 计算去重后的和与正确的和之差 -> 第二个数
#### 代码

```python
class Solution:
    def findErrorNums(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        S = sum(set(nums))
        return [sum(nums)-S ,len(nums)*(len(nums)+1)//2-S]
```
